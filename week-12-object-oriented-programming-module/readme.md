# Module 12: OOP

## Overview

In this module, we'll discuss object-oriented programming in JavaScript as we learn about constructors and the prototype chain. **Constructors** are special functions that help us create objects of similar types. **Prototypes** are JavaScript’s built-in system that allows objects to inherit features from other objects.

> **On the Job:** Prototypes are generally considered an advanced JavaScript concept. Mastering this concept will make you a more competitive JavaScript developer!

We'll also cover **test-driven development (TDD)**, which involves writing tests for application features before writing any code. Then we write only the minimum amount of code needed to make the tests pass&mdash;and repeat this process until the application is complete. Among its many benefits, test-driven development helps us write more understandable and maintainable code.

We'll conclude this unit with an introduction to modern class syntax and inheritance. ES6 introduced a `class` keyword, which allows us to create objects that use class structures like those found in other OOP programming languages. Essentially, classes are just constructor functions with more intuitive syntax. They allow us to implement more advanced OOP patterns, like inheritance, without needing to understand every aspect of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance system.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Constructors and classes are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types and allow for the development of very interesting applications.

* We will also spend a day in this module practicing TDD. Since students have limited exposure to testing, emphasize the importance and benefits of testing. Remind students that, just like with other libraries, syntax will fall into place over time.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)

* [Prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype)

* [Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain)

* [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

* [Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science))

  * [Method overloading](https://www.sanfoundry.com/java-program-find-area-square-rectangle-circle-using-method-overloading/)

* [Callback functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function)

* [constructor()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor)

  * [function() constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function)

* [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

  * [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started)

  * [Mock functions](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions)

  * [Mocking modules](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-functions#mocking-modules)

* [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

  * [Subclasses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Sub_classing_with_extends)

## Heads Up

* In the next module, we will be diving REACT. Spend as much time as you can making sure that students understand class structure and ES6 syntax as REACT heavily utilizes all of these things.

* Many students will benefit from more information about prototypal inheritance. Try to provide these students with the resources they need to succeed, but avoid spending too much in-class time if you notice that it's discouraging to struggling students.

## Challenge

In the challenge for this module, students will create an application that generates HTML files using input from a command-line interface. The application will gather information about their team or organization, and they'll be able to add as many team members as they want.
